# DoD OSD DEWS Reference Architecture — Draw.io Diagram

This repository contains a structured **Draw.io (`.xml`) diagram** that visually represents the **Directed Energy Weapon Systems Modular Open Systems Approach (DEWS MOSA RA)**, as developed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and documented in the publicly released PDF titled:

> *"An Overview of the Directed Energy Weapon Systems Modular Open Systems Approach Reference Architecture (DEWS MOSA RA)"*

## 📐 About the Architecture

The **DEWS Reference Architecture** provides a **Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)** for integrating Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) systems across multiple service branches and platforms (air, land, sea). It aims to guide and constrain development and procurement to achieve:

- **Rapid fielding** of DEWs with reduced R&D and integration time
- **Reusability** across programs and services
- **Interoperability** with various platforms and command-and-control (C2) networks
- **Modular components** with well-defined, vendor-agnostic interfaces

The architecture includes modules such as:

- 🔦 **Directed Energy Source**  
- 📡 **Beam Director and Beam Transport**  
- 🧠 **DEWS Management (System Monitor & Fire Control)**  
- 🧭 **Track Manager and External Data Ingestor**  
- 🎥 **Integrated Sensors, Cameras, and Trackers**  
- 🔧 **Support Systems** including Power, Thermal Management, and Data Storage  
- 🧑‍💻 **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**
